    heading: Why BrickbyBrick?
    text: " At BrickbyBrick, we are on a mission to reduce waste from the construction industry by giving it a new purpose and, hence, avoiding its final destination -landfills. Currently, the construction sector is the biggest consumer of raw materials and its related waste amounts to nearly a third of global waste. This leads to over one billion tonnes of construction waste produced yearly ending up on our landfills. To help reduce these threatening statistics, we aim to achieve circularity in the construction sector by recycling material's surplus and demolished construction material.
