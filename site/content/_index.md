blurb:
    heading: Why BrickbyBrick?
    text: " At BrickbyBrick, we are on a mission to end construction waste by giving it a new purpose and, hence, avoiding its final destination -landfills. Currently, the construction sector is the biggest consumer of raw materials and its related waste amounts to nearly a third of global waste. This leads to over one billion tonnes of construction waste produced yearly ending up on our landfills. To help reduce these threatening statistics, we aim to achieve circularity in the construction sector by recycling material's surplus and demolished contruction material.
    heading: "What we offer"
    text: "Our platform brings together construction contractors, with suppliers and owners of infrastructure material surplus in an effort to reduce the waste of construction materials. We strive to build a community of builders that value sustainability in their workplace without having to compromise on the quality of the source. "

    text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
